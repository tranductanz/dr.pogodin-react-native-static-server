The Glob library is a part of Android SDK starting from SDK 28; thus, to support
older SDKs we compile it from sources. These source files are taken from
the https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic repository
([bionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionic_%28software%29)
is Android's C library, math library, and dynamic linker).
